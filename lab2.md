Questions:
Which methods in your code are called?
What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?
How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.

- The main method and handleRequest methods are called
- The main method takes the port number as an argument, and handleRequest takes a URI as an argument.
  The list of strings is initialized to be empty and the count to 0.
- The list of strings gets a string added and the count is incremented to 1.
